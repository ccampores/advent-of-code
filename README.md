**Advent of Code**  
My Advent of Code 2018 solutions in Kotlin.  

I'll try to solve a problem everyday with a _working code first_ approach as a fun way to learn Kotlin, 
so the solution might not be always idiomatic or the most performant.  
I do intend to refactor the code though (if/when I have time).
